# FrontPage 98 Themes

Don't lie&mdash;I'm not the only person with profound nostalgia for old FrontPage 98 themes. They weren't all _good_, but that's half the fun.

I procured and launched FrontPage 98, and put together a page with a bunch of HTML components, then proceeded to save it in every theme available, download it with wget, and commit the result here.

Currently, the `192.168.1.13/` directory contains all the HTML (`.htm`, because why not?) pages, and most of the images are in `_derived` or `_themes`.

I believe sharing these is entirely kosher, given that the intent with FrontPage was to make sites and publish them to the web.

I'd like to tidy this up. More ambitiously, I'd like to try to convert this to CSS. I gave the page a title of `.` so I could try to get a text-free copy of the buttons, which have the text as part of the image. (FrontPage, reasonably, won't let you have a page with empty-string as a name.)

Tragically, the hit counters didn't seem to save properly. I'll have to dig more.

I didn't intend to mirror the other pages, but they lead to a version with a depressing gray theme. The link back doesn't work, because the page was initially called newpage1.htm and I renamed each to a theme-specific one.
